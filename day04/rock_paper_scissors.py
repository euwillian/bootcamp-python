# The Basic Rules of RPS

# Despite its underlying complexity, the gameâ€™s rules are straightforward.
# Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors,
# with the outcome determined by these three rules:

# Rock wins against scissors.
# Scissors win against paper.
# Paper wins against rock.
